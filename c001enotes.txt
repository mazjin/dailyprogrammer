Challenge 001 (easy): Taking input
---------------------------------
Actually taking the input was trivially simple; the errorcheck loop at the end
was really annoying to troubleshoot. Need to remember to use String.equals(otherstring)
to compare instead of ==. Had to look up writing to file for the bonus, not sure I understand
it super well, so will add that to the list of "Stuff I need to be less terrible
at". Also haven't written to file in any way incredibly helpful for appending or
 retrieving data.
  All in all, fairly simple to implement, considering.
