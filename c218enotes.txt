Turns out if you're using a literal number (eg 234567890) as a long, you need to
show it as such using an L, eg 234567890L.

May want to redo with with BigIntegers instead of longs: longs are still to small
to find the palindrome of 196196871 (should take 45 steps to get to 4478555400006996000045558744,
only reaches 26 steps)

This was oddly simple & quick: managed to write the vast majority of it in one go
with 2 minor errors setting strings as numbers and one error with the isPalindromic
checking subroutine not using equally sized first and last halves.

Finally implemented this one as an object!
