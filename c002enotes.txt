Challenge 002 (easy) : Functional calculator
-------------------------------------
Fairly simple; minus some small typos managed to get it working first time through.
Chose to make a calculator for wages at work, with the bonus extra function being that it
works in reverse; that is, it calculates how many hours you would have to work to
get a certain amount. Might actually find this useful to depress myself with when
considering new purchases (eg. that new iPhone isn't just Â£629.99, it's 87 hours
of work).
