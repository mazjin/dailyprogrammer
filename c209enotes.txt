Challenge 209 (easy): The Button
-----------------------
Not super happy with this; can't shake the feeling that I could have done it
more efficiently and with fewer declared variables. Nothing super new here, few
annoying errors, eg where time<times[i] wouldn't work but time>times[i] would, so
had to iterate backwards. Still unsure why but not getting anywhere and the
current implementation works, so it will remain a mystery, unfortunately.
