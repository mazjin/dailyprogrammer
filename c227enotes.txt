Challenge 227 easy- square spirals
----------------------------------
This was pretty tricky; yet another situation where I should have been more object-orientated
in creating my program but didn't, sigh. Had great fun trying to implement the
coordinate-reading part: need to remember that Scanner.nextLine() hates me.
Originally intended to make the grid a lot more graphical but proved to be far too
difficult: for some reason the grid didn't like using a loop to set all of the points
with odd x and y coordinates to + and all others to spaces. Same idea worked elsewhere,
so have to wonder what was going on there.

Learned a little about regexes while trying to split the input string: . is any
character, \d is any digit, \D is any non-digit, and regexes have to be escape-charactered
even if they already contain a backslash, bizarrely.
