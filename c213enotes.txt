Challenge 213 (easy): Pronouncing Hex
--------------------------
Really liked the idea behind this one. Managed to make it handle all the edge cases
(e.g. bitey after every bit, EXCEPT when the last digit of the bit is already
bitey/0) and longer strings of bits. Not 100% sure how to handle bits starting
with 0, as no rules or examples using it are given. Planned this out on paper a
few days ago but mostly had to go through solution again (forgot notebook).
Edge cases took the most effort here; implementing the subroutine to match each
character to an appropriate string was mostly just busy work.
  Thinking about it now, I could probably have streamlined it somewhat by using an
array or list and converting the hex values to grab the correct string, but not sure
how I would handle the hex part. Might implement that at some point.
