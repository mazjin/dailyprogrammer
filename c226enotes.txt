Challenge 226 easy (fractions)
This was actually fairly simple, few annoying errors:

 - using for loops instead of while loops for the last section of the main
method caused the for loops to be skipped entirely

  - using Scanner.nextLine() instead of Scanner.next() caused the first value
read to be automatically filled with something for some reason

Managed to add a function to convert the fractions formed into mixed fractions
as well, which was pleasingly simple

need to remember to use longs instead of ints for large numbers that still need
to be used to find a quotient from a / b.

should probably have created a fraction class and taken a more object-orientated
route through this one

need to look up/practice using arrays, lists, pairs, would probably have made this
easier or more more efficient
