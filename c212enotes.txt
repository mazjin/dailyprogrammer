Challenge 212 Easy : Rövarspråket translator
--------------------------

This one was pretty neat. Finished it in about 40 minutes, which was very nice
for my confidence. It was a good exercise in creating functions/subroutines
to clean things up without using complicated new methods. I will have to make sure
not to shy away from ever using new methods in the future, though.

Might need to stay away from solutions using Arrays.method methods, it seems
like those are part of Java 8 and I'm on 7 currently.

Bonus exercise is to create a decoder as well as an encoder.
Should be fairly simple I hope? Will hopefully do later.
-----------------------------------------------
Tried it a little bit; oddly enough was more difficult than I was expecting.
Might have to look up StringBuilders; they seem to behave a lot more like Python
strings, and I am sorely missing some of the default methods in Python at the moment
(someone posted a one-line in Python that I actually understood and could probably
have written myself). Might have to refresh my Python knowledge on the next task.
  --------------------------------
Got there in the end. Turns out the problem was that the for loop wasn't being
entered, so replaced it with a do-while loop instead and it was fine except for
minor problems, e.g. not translating uppercase letters properly.

Done and done!
