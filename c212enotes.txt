Challenge 212 Easy : Rövarspråket translator
--------------------------

This one was pretty neat. Finished it in about 40 minutes, which was very nice
for my confidence. It was a good exercise in creating functions/subroutines
to clean things up without using complicated new methods. I will have to make sure
not to shy away from ever using new methods in the future, though.

Might need to stay away from solutions using Arrays.method methods, it seems
like those are part of Java 8 and I'm on 7 currently.

Bonus exercise is to create a decoder as well as an encoder.
Should be fairly simple I hope? Will hopefully do later.
