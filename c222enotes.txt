Challenge 222 (easy): Balancing words
--------------------------------
This was an interesting one to try and implement without using pen and paper
(I'm an idiot and left the house without anything to write with). I feel like I
used too many subroutines to split up what could have been a small, neat, but
admittedly complicated solution. It would probably have been borderline incomprehensible
though.

Used the same commandline args technique as the last challenge (228 easy).

Have to keep an eye on what each value actually holds, the issue with using the
index of each letter in the alphabet string is that "a" should have a score of 1,
not 0, so I need to remember to add that on every time I print the value, but not
when retrieving the letter from the String.

All in all, considering I couldn't do this one in java a week ago, I think I did
pretty well to get it done inside of an hour. Need to make a similar leap to be
able to tackle the decolumnizing words challenge.
