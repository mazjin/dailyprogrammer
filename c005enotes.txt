Challenge 005 (easy): Password log-in
-------------------------
Pretty simple, had to remember how to use file i/o but wasn't too tricky apart
from that, seeing the other ostensible half of the program is just a simple
String.equals function and some other fluff. These earlier challenges are
definitely easier, I think.

Might come back to implement multiple users at some point.
