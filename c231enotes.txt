Challenge 231 (easy): Cellular Automata (rule 90)
-------------------------
Not too difficult this one, though I had some fun trying to get the regex
to work checking that the inputs were binary strings correctly. Ended up asking
someone for help and using a regex checker as well as a Pattern class that I've
never seen or heard of before, which I should probably learn more about. Got there
in the end though.
