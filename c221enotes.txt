Turns out that using the String.split(" ") method is much easier and less
complicated than trying to cut the string into substrings recursively.
Really need to work on learning regular expressions.

JESUS. This one was annoying, partially because I only half-learned about most
of the functions I was using, but mostly because logical operations in java
always seem a clusterfuck to me unless I separate it out into a million variables,
which doesn't do a lot for the tidiness of the code.

Ended up learning about/using Arrays(1d, then 2d), characters, switch statements,
a little more error correction than last time, pseudorandom number generators.

Still feeling like I'm not really doing the whole OO thing yet; hopefully will
start a challenge soon that lends itself well to starting to do so.

Made sure to clean up & comment code as well as uploading it to github; habits I
hope to keep from now on. It's probably still unreadable but hopefully better.
Need to revise the javadoc comment syntax at some point.
