Challenge 210 (easy) : intHarmony
------------------------------
Bit of a weird one. Need to go over my binary knowledge a bit more; very rusty.
Turns out java doesn't exactly "do" unsigned values, made everything a bit of a
faff to implement, but doesn't seem to have made much difference. Should keep reading
that CODE book so I understand the principles of these kinds of things more.
Only major hiccup was the fact that I was trying to implement the solution
using 8bit binary numbers, when the actual exercises only uses them to illustrate
the technique and asks you to you 32bit numbers. Still, it works!
