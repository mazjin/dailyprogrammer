Daily challenge222e (Garland words)

this was fairly easy with java, even accounting for the time getting back up to speed with the language
have to be careful with substrings, need to doublecheck tests (instead of implementing them, ignoring output, then wondering why the test words didn't work like today)

reading files for optional challenges turned out to be more difficult than I remembered;
need to be careful about catching the end of file early enough, do-while loops
a bit tricky for this (have to break in the middle, bit redundant )
