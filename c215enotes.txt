Challenge 215 (easy): Sad cycles
-------------------------
Half-learned about a new data structure to do this. ArrayLists are a bit of an
odd one, not quite got a handle on them yet; they don't share a lot of methods
with arrays or anything similar.

Lots of annoying fiddly bits to sort out coding
this, particularly our friend for loops, which managed to put my cycle finding
subroutine into disarray. I really need to figure out what about the way java
uses for loops make them not work in the way I expect and screw up my program.
Also should probably find some rules of thumb for when to use what data structure
/loop in general.
